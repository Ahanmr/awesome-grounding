# Awesome Language Grounding
A curated list of research papers in grounding. Link to the code if available is also present.

Language grounding task refers to localizing an object given a query or a sentence. It is somewhat related to Visual Question Answering so this repository might also help [https://github.com/JamesChuanggg/awesome-vqa](https://github.com/JamesChuanggg/awesome-vqa)
